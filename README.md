Repo for keeping notes on Math187A: Intro to cryptography

Structure of class includes weekly readings due 4pm Tues/Thurs, with lectures Wed/Fri covering topics from readings. I aim to keep notebooks to jot down anything of interest / play around in a python sandbox for relevant sections of the readings in the format `wXtue.ipynb` or `wXthu.ipynb` -- then following up / appending to said notebooks with anything of interest discussed in lectures.

> Save for `GDB.ipynb`, which was one of the earlier readings and I didn't really feel like going back and fixing old notebooks to comply with this new structure/organization/schema of note-taking.

Oh and Mondays are weekly quizzes so nothing there. Except maybe quiz corrections that I might also upload here for reference (along with any other OPEN assignments). Syllabus did note that we were allowed to collaborate with peers for quiz corrections so I don't believe this violates academic integrity.
